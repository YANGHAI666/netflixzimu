The FBI released a statement

00:10:23.247 --> 00:10:25.166  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Really? Well, my sources say
MacLeish overrode the FBI,

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.592  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why would the Vice President do that?

00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:38.137  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.930  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:45.269  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
MacLeish wanted him silenced.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.708  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He said he didn't want
to put our men at risk.

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:08.709  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay. Uh, well...

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.419  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

MacLeish was hiding something.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.423  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

I want to address the nation.

Sir, I'm not sure that's the best idea.

00:11:37.905 --> 00:11:40.032  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.284  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't think the country's ready

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The country deserves to know

00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:49.041  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think that anything
that you say at this point

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:51.210  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Wait for this news cycle to die down.

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:58.676  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That way, when you do say something,
it's proactive instead of just reacting

00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:00.511  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:17.945  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:28.706  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.099  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

MacLeish jumps in, stops it,
says that he was just following orders.
